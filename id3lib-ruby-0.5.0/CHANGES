= id3lib-ruby changes

=== 0.5.0 (2006-12-16)

* Warn when encountering nil field instead of raising exception (bug 6446).
* Corrected allowed fields - they are now generated from id3lib's source.
* Renamed :id field to :identifier because of confusion with frame ID.
* Added INSTALL document for installation instructions.
* Fixed memory leak in extension, where iterator was never released.
  According to tests, there is no memory leak anymore.
* Added two patches for id3lib in mswin32 gem:
  * unicode16: fixes Unicode writing bug
  * convert_i-leak: fixes memory leak in Unicode conversion function
* Updated to SWIG 1.3.31.

=== 0.4.1 (r53)

* Added :description to the allowed fields of :TXXX frames (patch 5484).
* Added more tests and a warning in README for writing of UTF-16 frames.

=== 0.4.0 (r41)

* Fixed Unicode problems (bug 4768).
* Renamed ID3Lib::API methods to be more like the id3lib method names.
  E.g. the GetType() method is now named get_type instead of type.

=== 0.3.1 (r32)

* Added check and messages for -lstdc++ and -lz to extconf.rb.
* Updated to SWIG 1.3.29.

=== 0.3.0 (r29)

* Added generation of mswin32 binary gem. This means that
  installing on Windows is a piece of cake. No dependencies, no
  compiling, just a gem installation.
* Changed Info.frame to use hash access instead of find -> faster.

=== 0.2.1 (r23)

* Fixed extconf.rb to print a message and abort if id3lib can't be
  found.

=== 0.2.0 (r21)

* Overhauled direct access methods
  * Remove frames by setting them to nil, e.g. tag.title = nil
  * Removed methods for rarely used frames.
  * All methods use strings now, no special cases like track anymore.
  * Explicit call of to_s in set_frame_text.
* More unit tests
* Added method invalid_frames which is useful to detect invalid frame
  data before calling update!.

=== 0.1.0 (r19)

* First release :)
